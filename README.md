### Revealing atomic identities in bilayer moiré materials
### 2024O Oct 22

Gomb-Net finds atoms, layer-wise, in STEM images of moiré materials

Gomb-Net is a multi-branch U-Net which trains using a unique groupwise output handling and combinatorial loss function.


Want to use Gomb-Net, but unsure how to start?
